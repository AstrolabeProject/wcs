The cadc-wcs library is the java interface to wcslib (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/). 

This library can be built on it's own but testing and beyond requires wcslib. The JNI binding library is
compiled and included inside the cadc-wcs jar file and deployed during class loading.

Versions: 
- cadc-wcs-1.x binaries on JCenter are linked against wcslib-4
- cadc-wcs-2.x binaries on JCenter are linked against wcslib-5
